This project is a menu-driven scientific calculator at basic level written in C language.
It performs both basic level arithmetic operations and advance mathematical operations.

//The list of operations which it can perform:-
1.Addition
2.Subtraction
3.Multiplication
4.Division
(with division by zero checking case)
5.Power operation
6.Modulus
7.Square root
8.Square of a number
9.Cube of a number

//The Concepts of C language which have been used in this project:-
1.Do-While Loop- for repeatedly displaying the menu until user chooses to exit.
2.'Switch' statements- for performing different operations based on user choice.
3.Conditional Statements- (if-else)
4.Mathematical Functions- pow(),sqrt(),etc
5.Standard libraries- like math.h
